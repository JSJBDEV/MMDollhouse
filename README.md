# Mob Mystery Doll House
An overly ModFest: Toybox entry

# What?
In Mob Mystery Dollhouse you find Dollhouse blocks in chests around the world and can place them down.
Once placed, you can interact with the dollhouse to "enter" it - you are then presented with a mystery to solve.

You start in the main room faced by 6 suspects, The Evoker, The Pillager, The Witch, The Illusioner, The Vindicator and The Shady Merchant

Your job is to determine how, who and where, Villager Joe was slain. There are several rooms in the house, and you start with a book
of initial information from each of the suspects, you must use the information you collect from around the house (Notes, Items and Passwords) to 
make a final verdict and determine ***whodunnit***

## Tips

- No one can lie (currently)
- In the initial questions, if a suspect talks about the stock of the item, that was what it was before the tragedy
- The antagonist always acts by themselves
- if a clue contains a suspect, a weapon and a room together the true answer won't overlap with any other
